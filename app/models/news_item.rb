# a NewsItem represents any announcement that we want to communicate to our
# web audience.
#
# When it is marked as `published`, a `published_at` is automatically added/updated
# and will decide on the display order of that `news_item`
#
# NOTE: [legacy]
# - This is also where we imported the old wordpress posts
# - The `slug` is purely used to store the old wordpress slug and make sure we
#   can still resolve: http://www.montrealrb.com/[post_date:YYYY]/[post_date:MM]/[post_name]
